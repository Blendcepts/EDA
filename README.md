# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A Deep Dive into the Data
EDA is the detective work of data analysis. It's about getting to know your data intimately, uncovering hidden patterns, and forming hypotheses before diving into formal modeling or hypothesis testing. Think of it as the crucial first step in any data-driven journey.

## The Process:

1. Data Collection and Preparation:
    - Gather your data from various sources, ensuring its quality and relevance.
	- Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. Descriptive Statistics:
	- Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles) to understand the central tendency, spread, and distribution of your data.
	- Use these statistics to get a basic sense of the data's characteristics.
3. Univariate Analysis:
	- Examine each variable individually to understand its distribution and identify potential issues.
	- Use histograms, box plots, and density plots to visualise the data's shape and identify outliers.
4. Bivariate Analysis:
	- Explore relationships between pairs of variables.
	- Use scatter plots, correlation matrices, and cross-tabulations to identify potential associations and dependencies.
5. Multivariate Analysis:
	- Investigate relationships between three or more variables simultaneously.
	- Use techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis to reduce dimensionality and uncover underlying patterns.
6. Data Visualisation:
	- Create meaningful visualisations (charts, graphs, maps) to communicate insights and patterns effectively.
	- Use appropriate visualisation techniques to highlight key findings and support your analysis.
